This is a collection of some "just for fun" personal projects, some going back as far as 2009.  The code quality may be questionable in some areas for that reason, so if you see something that raises an eyebrow just ask me how I would do it today, in a production context, and hopefully I can alleviate any concerns.  

Thanks for visiting!  :)
