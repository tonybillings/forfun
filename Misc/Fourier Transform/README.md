Not sure why I made this app, but you can use it to see what happens when you combine sine waves of various amplitudes/frequencies/phases.  That code was written by me, while another feature that can convert a wave representation from the time domain to the frequency domain (spectrum/band analysis) was implemented using a popular Fast Fourier Transform library written in C# (by someone that's much better in math than I am).
