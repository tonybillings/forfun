When I learned about steganography I had to create something employing the technique!  It's a command-line tool that allows you to both encrypt and *hide* (the steganography part) some secret text within a bitmap (\*.bmp).  It works by hijacking the least significant two bits of each channel in a RGB24 pixel so as to use it to store (hide) the encrypted data.  A bitmap with lots of variation (like a photo of the outdoors or your cat) is recommended, otherwise if you chose a solid color you may notice that, starting from the lower-right corner and moving left/up, rows of pixels that are a slightly different shade of that solid color!
