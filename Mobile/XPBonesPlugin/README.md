This is a mod for the flight simulator X-Plane.  It sends cockpit data to an Android tablet that displays futuristic-looking guages for things like fuel, altitude, orientation, etc.  The mod and Android app were written in C++.  It was the first time I used OpenGL (though I used WebGL once before) and the graphics were implemented using my own code (no 3rd-party libraries used, just OpenGL).
