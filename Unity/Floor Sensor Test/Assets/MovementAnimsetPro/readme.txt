Movement Animset Pro v.1.5
--------------------


This is a complete set of motion capture animations, to build a seamless third person perspective character movement for your game. The animations are universal, so you can use them for any setting you like - SciFi, Fantasy etc. It also includes an example TPP controller.

It comes with an example of Mecanim Controller graph. It also includes an example controller, made with Playmaker (Playmaker is needed to use it; If you do not have Playmaker, you will have to script your own controller for included Mecanim graph, or just use the animations however you like).



It consists of 180 animations from which you can make game mechanics for:

- Standing
- Walking
- Running
- Crouching / Sneaking
- Jumping
- Falling
- Interactions (button pushing, picking up objects etc.)
- Fist fighting
- Deaths and knockdowns

It also contains:
- Skinned model of a modern day soldier (26,536 tris, 13,813 verts)
- Skinned model of a dummy, to preview animations

It also contains:
- an example TPP character controller made with PlayMaker and MECANIM example controller graph.

--------------------

Animations are cut to ready-to-use clips. They have an animated Root bone, so you can use Root Motion and move the character around just with animations. All the transition between standing, walking, running and crouching are included. Animations use Unity's Humanoid rig, but they can be easly converted to Generic rig, with 2 mouse clicks. If you wish to have all those animations in place (with no Root Motion), just uncheck "Enable Root Motion" in your Animator Prefab in the Scene or delete the animation from Root bone in animations.

The skeleton that animations are baked on to is a standard, Motionbuilder compatible skeleton. It has Motionbuilder hierarchy and naming convention. Hips, Neck and Head have Z axes pointing forward, so you can use Look At constraints etc.



See MAP_Unity_v1.5_animlist.pdf to get full description of each animation.
