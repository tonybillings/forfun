                A set of instructions contained within the same scope will be
                compiled into a Verilog ROM module before being synthesized on
                the FPGA chip.  This manual sometimes refers to such a set of
                instructions as a program ROM (or program) since it contains the
                logic that constitutes a software application or program.

                Like any ROM module, a program ROM has an input bus for the data address
                and an output bus for the data at the selected address.  In the case of
                a program ROM, the "data" is an instruction that can be executed by a
                Tonium processor core.

                A processor core utilizes an instruction pointer to maintain its current
                position in the program ROM.  On each clock cycle, it increments the
                pointer so as to execute the next instruction in the program.
                However, most programs will manipulate the instruction pointer (via a specific
                kind of instruction) in order to implement various forms of flow control
                logic such as loops and functions.  If a core reaches the end of a program's
                instruction list, it will simply loop back to the beginning and execute the
                program again.  Of course, it is possible to prevent this behavior by
                manipulating the instruction pointer.
