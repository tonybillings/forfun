                The first register in L1 cache, R0, holds the instruction pointer for the program ROM.  The instruction pointer determines which instruction
                is executed next, therefore by manipulating this value it is possible to implement if/then statments, loops, function calls, etc, in the program.  Although
                this can be done by keeping track of the instruction index manually and setting R0 accordingly, it is far easier to rely on labels and the 'goto' keyword.

                A label statement is defined by a word followed by a colon, with no spaces in between.  The word may contain letters, numbers and underscores,
                in any combination.  Labels are case-sensitive.  The following label statements are all valid:
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <div class="code">
                begin: <br />
                delay_loop: <br />
                func_1: <br />
                1: <br />
                _:
            </div>
            <br />
            <span>
                A label essentially references the instruction that follows it, making it possible to set the instruction pointer by setting R0 to the label:
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <div class="code">
                loop:
                <div class="code indented-code">
                    ADD R3 R3 1 <br />
                    BEQ R3 255 <br />
                    SET R0 loop
                </div>
            </div>
            <br />
            <span>
                The example above increments R3 until it equals 255, at which time it will exit the loop.  However, the third instruction statement can be rewritten
                using the 'goto' keyword to more clearly state the intended action:
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <div class="code">
                loop:
                <div class="code indented-code">
                    ADD R3 R3 1 <br />
                    BEQ R3 255 <br />
                    goto loop
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
