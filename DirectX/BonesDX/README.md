BonesDX is a graphics framework/engine leveraging DirectX 11 and is written in C++.  Several aspects of its design have been inspired from my use of Unreal Engine, Unity, and XNA Framework.  All of the code is my own, with the exception of the included DirectX Toolkit files (the WIC/DDS texture loaders and DirectXHelpers.h).
